This is disaster management is a dance performance created during a residency at Chez Bushwick Studios (NY) and performed at Center for Performance Research (NY) as part of the Exponential Festival in January 2017. The performers of this work are Aye Eckerson, Leanna Grennan, Isabella Jackson, Ella Misko, Sara Rodriguez and Tamia Ruiz, featuring storytelling artist Thelma Thomas. Questions surrounding the mechanics of disaster management, a field of study and action that developed significantly in the US in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, were the starting place for our residency in 2016. Some of these questions, which catalyzed our studio work:

How to physically explore solidarity and togetherness?
How to transmit responsiveness & working together?
How to create a performance that works as a platform for a plurality of voices and perspectives? 
How to chase-travel-journey within these walls?

*No answers, but some physical actions and practices developed:*

repetititive looping-to-alter material; 
   overlapping textures and planes in space in small groups; 
  "shifting alliances" between groups (Judith Butler); 
       movement that both fixes and shifts the body in space via polyrhythms met with stillness; 
 teaching each other different fragments of materials...

*And then, still no answers, but more questions:*

What is the nature of (our) resilience? 
  Is the emphasize in this sojourning on where we left, or where we are going, or...?
