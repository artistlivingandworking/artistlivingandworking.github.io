Collaborative Precarity Bodyhacking is a series of cross-disciplinary workshops 
addressing precarity’s trauma-resonant effects on mind and body programming. 
These intensive gatherings will employ individual and group work that includes 
writing, performance, movement, breath work, mindfulness, and dialogue. 
We will make space for reading, ritual, and emergent documentation. 
No previous experience in any of these disciplines is necessary, and exercises 
will be adaptable to the needs and abilities of different bodies. 
We have created a workbook full of resources, scores, and annotations for 
further research based on these workshops. This will be available on site for $5-10.
