Performance Practices workshop facilitated by Commitment Experiment
Saturday January 26th 10am - 12pm Suggested $10

Commitment Experiment is a performance collective that has met weekly since the beginning of October 2018. 
With the promise of showing up, our seven person collective continues to share and interrogate our
practices as performance makers once a week, every week, no excuses. We open up our collective space
here to facilitate a partnered talking and body work exercise, a group practice centered on mining our
histories as they relate to nature and the natural, and a collective sewing practice where we interrogate
historical usage of the black flag as we bring back the radical roots of the word *gossip*.

Founding members (pictured here) include Cory Tamler, Elena Rose Light, Janine Cunningham, 
Alex Viteri Arturo, Rachel Kauder Nalebuff, and myself.
