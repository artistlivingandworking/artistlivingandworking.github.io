Right now we are 35 meters above sea level but let’s sink. ecotone attempts to concentrate a 35
minute performance gathering into a public witnessing project: together we are in study of 
(with) a shapeshifting body who floods. We enter into the humid proximity of water. Water as
carrier and barrier: glaciers who melt and become immobilized; whales who eat plastic and
become landfills; puddles of toxic algae who become host to entire ecologies of life. I transmit
an intra-corporeal gossip: cyphering atmospheric information throughout my body’s sedimenting
& spilling landscapes. Choreographies and modes of sensing enfold. This body is kindred to the
river who is insubordinate against her borders simply because she has crossed them before: 
flooding, meandering, remembering. My tempo is a persistent unfolding: navigation of the low-tide 
Mediterranean during a New Moon (19 aout;17 septembre; 16 octobre…), where the water becomes deep 
enough that my feet don’t touch the sand. Traversing wetlands, we are at the ecotone – the 
somehow undefinable borderzone that is created when ecosystems clash, merge, and meet.
