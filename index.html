        What you see before you is a memorial ship. We are what’s left of a life of travel between the shores. We are full of rust. Our anchor is down. You have permission to see between the—walk between the cracks.
        <br><br>
        We are complicated stillness.
        <br><br>
        We are stormy Tara Sophie Izzy Ella Aye Leanna and Ann-Marie. Or versions of them. Or a fraction of who we were before. We’re unsure of what is next.
        <br><br>
        We are melodrama trauma freaks who walk like riverboats on fire.
        <br><br>
        The beer is to your right.
